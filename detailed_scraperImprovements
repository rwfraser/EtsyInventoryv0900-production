Gemsngems scraper improvements:  1/10/26
- add min required order quantity
- add vendor name to all products
- filter out 'drilled', 'hole', "flat bottom","briolette"
- fix the hardcoded API key
- move product URL to start of section from end of section
- refine AI prompt, for example: ASSCHER is a CUT, not a shape therefore provide translation table of cuts <=> shapes in the prompt example: cushion is a square cut i.e. cushion cut = square shape, asscher cut = square shape
